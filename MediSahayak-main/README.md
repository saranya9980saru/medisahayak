 Our problem statement was:
### Al Assisted Tele-medicine for Rural India
Health care in rural India is still an unresolved area
that demands improved and innovative solutions. The easy
availability and access to expert doctors, according to the

medical condition of the individual/patient can be provided by
the Al-assisted telemedicine robotic  that can be set up
anywhere in the village. Individuals may mark their identity
through the biometric scanner. A robot may speak to the
individual, enquiring about the illness. Later, the individual will
be directed online to an expert doctor, via e-sanjeevani App.
After the consultation, medicines and other associated services
can be provided to them through the local Asha worker without
any delay.
